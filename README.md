# Control Autorig
The Control AutoRig tool is created for Autodesk Maya which simplifies the creation of FK and IK controls through an intuitive user interface. It streamlines the process of setting up controls, although it does not generate the joints themselves (that's a pre-requisite).

## **Pre-requisites**
You have a character rig that has properly named joints skinned to the mesh but no controls. Example- [mixamo rigs](https://www.mixamo.com/#/)

## **Are you?**
- A small 3D animation studio
- An indie game development studio
- A 3D animator who wishes to create short animations
- A student trying to learn 3D animation and you have basic rigging skills

## **Are you using a free character rig for your 3D animation? And it has-**
- Good **joint placements/orientation** and you want to keep that!
- Great **skinning** and you do not want any changes to happen there.
- Nice **naming convention** for joints.


**BUT-**
- **NO CONTROLLERS**; just the joints to animate.

## **You might want this tool so that you can...** 
- **Easily create color-coded controllers** for the joints without changing the joint placement/orientation/skinning
- Have controllers named according to your joint **naming convention**

## Environment [in development]
- [x] **OS**      : Windows
- [x] **Software**: Maya 2020+ 

## **Project Features**
- [x] Easy-to-use User Interface in Maya
- [x] FK Controls
